# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities using
[GitHub integrated security reporting](https://github.com/fgm/container/security/advisories/new)

Do <strong>not</strong> open issues on GitHub with security-sensitive content,
as that would make the report public.

## Response Process

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours during the work week,
and provide an estimated timeline for a fix and release if we can.

## Supported Versions

| Version    |     Supported      |

| 0.1.0      | :white_check_mark: |
| main (dev) |        :x:         |

## Disclosure Policy

We will publicly disclose vulnerabilities after a fix has been released and users have had sufficient time to update.

## Credits

This is where we will acknowledge researchers who have responsibly disclosed actual vulnerabilities,
once fixed.
